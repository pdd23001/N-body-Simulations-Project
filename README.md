# Quantum Close-Neighbors Finding Algorithms for finding N-Body Simulations in Physics

Right now working with Close-Neighbors 2 from Dr. Raj's paper.

Only relevant file is close_neighbors_2.ipynb for running the code
The grover mechanism is defined in grover_v2.py
The theta finding mechanisms (required in some parts of the algorithm) are defined in find_theta_v3.py
Oracle has been defined in oracles_grover.py (ignore marked_oracle_v2 in that)

Number of particles, and neighbors per particle can be changed from the cell just below imports in close_neighbors_2.ipynb
